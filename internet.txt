The Internet is a vast network that connects millions of computers globally. 
It operates on a range of protocols, the primary one being the Internet Protocol (IP). 
The Internet enables various services such as email, web browsing, and file sharing. 
Key concepts include IP addresses, which uniquely identify devices on the network, and DNS (Domain Name System), which translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses. 
Understanding the Internet's structure and function is crucial for navigating and utilizing its resources effectively.
