HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. 
It is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. 
It follows a client-server model where requests are made by recipients (clients) to servers, which respond with the requested resources. 
HTTP methods such as GET and POST define the types of operations to be performed. 
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP with encryption for secure communication over a computer network.
